        <p>Working with Lee has been an incredible experience.
           I appreciate her attention to detail and the way she was able 
           to bring my vision to life, even when I started off unsure of what exactly that 
           would look like. She was quick to answer every question I had with patience and kindness. 
           Lee truly went above and beyond to help guide me through the entire process. She was able to take my 
           scattered content and create an organized, clean and professional website that is easy to navigate - and looks amazing!
